(2) the blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive c reactive protein (hs-crp) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. in most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), total bilirubin (tbil), serum creatinine (scr) and other items showed no significant changes.

first case of covid-19 was detected in spain, an imported case from germany in canary islands, and thereafter on february 25th the first case was detected in madrid. the first case of covid-19 was confirmed at the hospital universitario 12 de octubre on march 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern madrid. during march 2020 highly active circulation of sars-cov-2 was experienced in madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by march 29th. methods since the beginning of the epidemics the occupational health and safety service (ohss) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. for molecular diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the microbiology laboratory by automatized specific pcr methods that was operative from february 25th as part of the preparedness. results from a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 ) were tested during the period 1-29 march 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). the first hcw infected was confirmed on march 9th. a total of 791 hcw and personnel were confirmed to be infected by march 29th, representing 38 of those tested and 11,6 of all the hospital workers. the proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between hcw and those patients attending at the emergency department (er) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of sars-cov-2 positive pcr detection between hcw from high risk areas involved in close contact with covid-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. the curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and hcw during march 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. discussion the recommendation from our ohss did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of hcw and non-sanitary personnel was tested in march 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 of the hospital employees. most of the covid-19 cases among the hospital hcw and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the icu. no fatalities occurred during the study period. although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from covid-19 patients to hcws, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of hcw and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (march 2020) between patients attending the er and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. this experience is similar to the communicated from wuhan verified by the who joint mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the netherlands, where most of the infections of hcw were related to household or community contacts. significance since the collective of hospital hcw are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for sars-cov-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. there appears to be a close connection between hcw infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by sars-cov-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. since a significant proportion of covid-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 is a minimum estimation of the impact of sars-cov-2 circulation in madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. this is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. this has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment,

infected was confirmed on march 9th. a total of 791 hcw and personnel were confirmed to be infected by march 29th, representing 38 of those tested and 11,6 of all the hospital workers. the proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between hcw and those patients attending at the emergency department (er) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of sars-cov-2 positive pcr detection between hcw from high risk areas involved in close contact with covid-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. the curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and hcw during march 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. discussion the recommendation from our ohss did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of hcw and non-sanitary personnel was tested in march 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 of the hospital employees. most of the covid-19 cases among the hospital hcw and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the icu. no fatalities occurred during the study period. although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from covid-19 patients to hcws, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of hcw and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (march 2020) between patients attending the er and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. this experience is similar to the communicated from wuhan verified by the who joint mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the netherlands, where most of the infections of hcw were related to household or community contacts. significance since the collective of hospital hcw are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for sars-cov-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. there appears to be a close connection between hcw infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by sars-cov-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. since a significant proportion of covid-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 is a minimum estimation of the impact of sars-cov-2 circulation in madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. this is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. this has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","sars-cov-2 infection in health care workers in a large public hospital in madrid, spain, during march 2020 [SEP] background on january 31st the first case of covid-19 was detected in spain, an imported case from germany in canary islands, and thereafter on february 25th the first case was detected in madrid. since a significant proportion of covid-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 is a minimum estimation of the impact of sars-cov-2 circulation in madrid during the first 4 weeks of the

17 (60.7) patients were male. median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.070.0) years. lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n 7; 25.0). eight (28.6) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission. the following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n 23, 82.1), dry cough (n 22, 81), and dyspnoea (n 14, 50.0), along with lymphopaenia (n 23, 82.1), high level of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (n 23, 82.1), anaemia (n 21, 75.0), and hypoproteinaemia (n 25, 89.3). the common chest computed tomography (ct) findings were ground-glass opacity (n 21, 75.0) and patchy consolidation (n 13, 46.3). a total of 15 (53.6) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6. if the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events hazard ratio (hr) 4.079, 95 confidence interval (ci) 1.08615.322, p 0.037. furthermore, patchy consolidation on ct on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (hr 5.438, 95 ci 1.49819.748, p 0.010). conclusions: cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the covid-19 infection. it is recommended that cancer patients receiving antitumour treatments should have vigorous screening for covid-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of covid-19 coinfection.","clinical characteristics of covid-19-infected cancer patients: a retrospective case study in three hospitals within wuhan, china [SEP] background: cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n 23, 82.1), dry cough (n 22, 81), and dyspnoea (n 14, 50.0), along with lymphopaenia (n 23, 82.1), high level of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (n 23, 82.1), anaemia (n 21, 75.0), and hypoproteinaemia (n 25, 89.3)."

however, owing to higher transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of mers are characterized by sharper incidence peaks. the probability of occurrence of mers outbreaks larger than the south korean cluster (n 186) is of the order of 1 . conclusions: our study suggests that the south korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of mers and sars could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses. electronic supplementary material: the online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12916-015-0450-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",2015-03-09,"chowell, gerardo;

p 0.0001), with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for mers than sars. simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks (100 cases) for sars than mers (2 versus 1 ); however, owing to higher transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of mers are characterized by sharper incidence peaks. the probability of occurrence of mers outbreaks larger than the south korean cluster (n 186) is of the order of 1 . conclusions: our study suggests that the south korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of mers and sars could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses. electronic supplementary material: the online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12916-015-0450-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","transmission characteristics of mers and sars in the healthcare setting: a comparative study [SEP] background: the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the arabian peninsula since 2012. moreover, the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks (kruskalwallis test;

administered in ovo; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene. rational attenuation of ibv requires the identification of genes that are simultaneously not essential for replication and whose absence would reduce pathogenicity. being able to modify a core vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so, and the demonstration that spike-swapping is sufficient to induce good immunity. we have demonstrated that four small ibv proteins, encoded by genes 3 and 5, are not essential for replication;

administered in ovo; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene. rational attenuation of ibv requires the identification of genes that are simultaneously not essential for replication and whose absence would reduce pathogenicity. being able to modify a core vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so, and the demonstration that spike-swapping is sufficient to induce good immunity. we have demonstrated that four small ibv proteins, encoded by genes 3 and 5, are not essential for replication; failure to produce these proteins had little detrimental affect on the titre of virus produced. our current molecularly cloned ibv, strain beaudette, is non-pathogenic, so we do not know what effect the absence of these proteins would have on pathogenicity. that said, plaque size and composition of various gene 3/5 recombinant ibvs in cell culture, and reduced output and ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures, shows that they are less aggressive than the wild-type beaudette. consequently these genes remain targets for rational attenuation. we have recently obtained evidence that one or more of the 15 proteins encoded by gene 1 are also determinants of pathogenicity. hence gene 1 is also a target for rational attenuation. replacing the s protein gene of beaudette with that from the pathogenic m41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still non-pathogenic but which did induce protection against challenge with m41. we have since made other spike-swapped recombinants, including ones with chimaera s genes. uniquely, our molecular clone of beaudette is benign when administered to 18-day-old embryos, even at high doses, and induces immunity after this route of vaccination. taken together, our results point to the creation of a new generation of ib vaccines, based on rational modification of the genome, as being a realisable objective.",manipulation of the infectious bronchitis coronavirus genome for vaccine development and analysis of the accessory proteins() [SEP] infectious bronchitis coronavirus (ibv) is the cause of the single most economically costly infectious disease of domestic fowl in the ukand probably so in many countries that have a developed poultry industry. replacing the s protein gene of beaudette with that from the pathogenic m41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still non-pathogenic but which did induce protection against challenge with m41.
