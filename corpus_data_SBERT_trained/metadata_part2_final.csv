a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to cdc for further antigenic characterization. results: of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83 tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71 tested positive for influenza a or b virus. antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. conclusions: the high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ari. this finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. however, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.","laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance pilot project on select cruise ships in alaska, 201315() [SEP] background: influenza outbreaks can occur among passengers and crews during the alaska summertime cruise season. from may to september 20132015, the alaska division of public health, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in alaska."

p00001), and was 2 (5/218) in health-care workers. after excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 217, iqr 510). the median incubation period was significantly shorter in group a than in group c (5 days iqr 48 vs 11 days 612; p00001). there were no confirmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on may 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. the main risk factor for transmission of mers-cov was the location of exposure. interpretation: our results showed increased transmission potential of mers-cov from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases. funding: none.",2016-07-09,"cho, sun young;

p00001), and was 2 (5/218) in health-care workers. after excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 217, iqr 510). the median incubation period was significantly shorter in group a than in group c (5 days iqr 48 vs 11 days 612; p00001). there were no confirmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on may 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. the main risk factor for transmission of mers-cov was the location of exposure. interpretation: our results showed increased transmission potential of mers-cov from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases. funding: none.","mers-cov outbreak following a single patient exposure in an emergency room in south korea: an epidemiological outbreak study [SEP] background: in 2015, a large outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) infection occurred following a single patient exposure in an emergency room at the samsung medical center, a tertiary-care hospital in seoul, south korea. there were no confirmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on may 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case."
