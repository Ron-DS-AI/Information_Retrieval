Information retrieval assignment collab

Search Engine Presentation and Demo
The aim of assignments is to fully understand how a search engine is built by actually design and implementing the search engine, and to present and demonstrate it to us. The expectated outcome is a search system which allows to enter a query (could be via a command line or GUI) and get as an output, i.e., a ranked list of documents. In the presentation, the following should be made clear:

the indexing method you have used, and show some sample data
the retrieval method you have used, and be able to explain the ranking you obtain
show how everything works on the documents collection which has been provided.

What you are asked to submit is:
A set of slides summarising your work
A video recording of your presentation based on the slides
A video recording of a live demo which shows a complete search process with your search engine
A package of source code or any other files related to your implementation with some test data, to allow us verify the implementation and reproduce your experiment.
The recordings should be no more than 8 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of demo. The following marking scheme will be used to assess the search engine presentations:
Timing, structure, clarity, presentation skills 25%
Functionality of system 25%
Architecture of system 25%
Engineering and design competence 25%
